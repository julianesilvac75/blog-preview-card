## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time following a Figma design and trying to make it the most similar to the design possible. It was confusing at first, but once I started to understand how Figma works, it made the design building process much easier.
